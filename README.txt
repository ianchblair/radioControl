Arduino sketches for radio control using nRF24 based on "HowToMechatronics"  design. (www.HowTMechatronics.com).
These are adapted slightly to suit a radio contro boat.
The transmitter (rc_tx) continuously sends a map of the button and lever settings to the receiver.
The receiver converts these to outputs (servo style for the ESC and rudder, switched logic for the pushbuttoss, 
e.g. for nav lights.
Usage subject to the requirements of www.howtomechatronics.com, and requires their hardware design.
